# Sequence Tagging with Feature Generation and Parameter Optimization

Named Entity Recognition (NER) , also known as entity chunking/extraction , is a popular technique used in information extraction to identify and segment the named entities and classify or categorize them under various predefined classes. 

This code generates features on a text corpus and creates NER tags with the CRF_suite package (python). 

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using RandomSearchCV.
